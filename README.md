# Adiabatic_Flame_Temperature
For a combustion process that takes place adiabatically with no shaft work, the temperature of the products is referred to as the adiabatic flame temperature. This is the maximum temperature that can be achieved for given reactants. Heat transfer, incomplete combustion, and dissociation all result in lower temperature. The maximum adiabatic flame temperature for a given fuel and oxidizer combination occurs with a stoichiometric mixture (correct proportions such that all fuel and all oxidizer are consumed). The amount of excess air can be tailored as part of the design to control the adiabatic flame temperature.
